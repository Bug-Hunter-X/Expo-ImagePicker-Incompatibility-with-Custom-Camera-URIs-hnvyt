This bug occurs when using the Expo ImagePicker library in conjunction with a custom camera component. The issue is that the selected image URI from the custom camera is not properly handled by the ImagePicker's `pickImageAsync` function, leading to an error or unexpected behavior. Specifically, the URI might not be compatible with the ImagePicker's internal handling, resulting in a failure to display the image or other image-related operations.
