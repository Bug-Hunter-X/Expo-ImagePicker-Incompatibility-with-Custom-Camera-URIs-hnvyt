This repository contains a demonstration of a bug encountered when using Expo's ImagePicker with a custom camera implementation. The problem arises from incompatibility between the custom camera's image URI and the ImagePicker's handling of URIs. The `bug.js` file showcases the buggy behavior, while `bugSolution.js` provides a working solution.  The solution involves modifying how the URI is handled to ensure compatibility with Expo's ImagePicker.
